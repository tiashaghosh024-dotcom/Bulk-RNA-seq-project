# Bulk-RNA-seq-project
Overview: 
This project aims to show a complete Bulk RNA-Seq workflow- from raw sequencing data up to differential expression analysis using DESeq2. We tried to analyse the effect of hypoxia on gene expression in two cancer cell lines LNCAP and PC3.
For each cell lines, Hypoxia vs Normoxia was compared to identify genes that responded to low O2 levels.
